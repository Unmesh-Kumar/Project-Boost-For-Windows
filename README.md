This is the first dynamic game I ever developed with unity.This game is basically based on the concept of flappy bird.In this you have to take the rocket to the green landing pad without obstacles.Use Space Bar for thrusting and Left and right arrows for rotating.Please give it a try and play it in utra graphics quality.
